            <h3>Steps:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Winner Selection</strong>: The AI agent selects a winner based on engagement metrics. One user can win maximum once per week.</li>
                <li><strong>Announcement</strong>: The AI agent announces the winner in the main Telegram group chat.
                    <p>Example message: "Congratulations @username! You have been selected as today's top contributor. Please check your private messages to provide your wallet address for the reward."</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Private Message</strong>: The AI agent sends a private message to the winner requesting their wallet address.
                    <p>Example private message: "Hi @username, congratulations on being selected as today's top contributor! Please reply with your wallet address to receive your reward."</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Wallet Address Submission</strong>: The winner responds with their wallet address.
                    <p>Example response: "My wallet address is 0x1234...5678."</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Verification</strong>: The AI agent verifies the wallet address format.

                                </li>
                                <li><strong>Token Holding Verification</strong>: The AI agent checks the winner's wallet on the blockchain to verify the amount of gMetis tokens held.</li>
                                <li><strong>Reward Calculation</strong>: Based on the token holdings, the AI agent calculates the reward amount using the following logic:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>If the user holds 50,000 gMetis tokens, they receive 100% of the reward (250,000 tokens).</li>
                                        <li>If the user holds no tokens, they receive 20% of the reward (1,000 tokens).</li>
                                        <li>For other amounts, the reward ( A ) is calculated as:
                                            <pre></br>A = 250,000 × (0.2 + (H / 50,000) × 0.8)</pre>
                                            where ( H ) is the number of gMetis tokens held by the user.</br>
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>Reward Distribution</strong>: The AI agent initiates an on-chain transaction to send the calculated reward to the winner's wallet.</li>
                                <li><strong>Public Ledger Update</strong>: The AI agent updates the public ledger or the reward distribution section on the website.</li>
                            </ol>
                
                            <h2>Criteria for Selecting Winners</h2>
                            <p>Winners are chosen based on their interaction metrics, such as the number of messages and the quality of their contributions. The AI ensures the selection process is fair and transparent. <br/>One user can win maximum once per week</p>
