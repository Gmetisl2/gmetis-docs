            <p>"AI Agent - Meme token with a hint of utility in case the market moves that way."</p>

            <h1 id="tokenomics">Tokenomics</h1>
            <h2>Token Type and Specifications</h2>
            <p>gMetis is an ERC-20 token adhering to the latest standards. It is designed to be simple and efficient, with no additional features such as minting, burning, or pausing capabilities after the initial mint.</p>
            <h2>Total Supply</h2>
            <p>The total supply of gMetis is 10,000,000 tokens.</p>
            <h2>Token Allocation</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>30% (3,000,000 gMetis): Provided in the liquidity pool for public token sale on Hercules DEX (Metis mainnet, Andromeda). Liquidity will be locked for 2 years.</li>
                <li>36.5% (3,650,000 gMetis): Allocated for rewards.</li>
                <li>13.5% (1,350,000 gMetis): Team budget.</li>
                <li>10% (1,000,000 gMetis): Infrastructure costs.</li>
                <li>10% (1,000,000 gMetis): Marketing.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Budget Allocation</h2>

            <h3>Steps:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Winner Selection</strong>: The AI agent selects a winner based on engagement metrics. One user can win maximum once per week.</li>
                <li><strong>Announcement</strong>: The AI agent announces the winner in the main Telegram group chat.
                    <p>Example message: "Congratulations @username! You have been selected as today's top contributor. Please check your private messages to provide your wallet address for the reward."</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Private Message</strong>: The AI agent sends a private message to the winner requesting their wallet address.
                    <p>Example private message: "Hi @username, congratulations on being selected as today's top contributor! Please reply with your wallet address to receive your reward."</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Wallet Address Submission</strong>: The winner responds with their wallet address.
                    <p>Example response: "My wallet address is 0x1234...5678."</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Verification</strong>: The AI agent verifies the wallet address format.
                                    <p>Example message: "Thank you, @username. Your wallet address has been received and verified. Your reward will be processed shortly."</p>
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>Token Holding Verification</strong>: The AI agent checks the winner's wallet on the blockchain to verify the amount of gMetis tokens held.</li>
                                <li><strong>Reward Calculation</strong>: Based on the token holdings, the AI agent calculates the reward amount using the following logic:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>If the user holds 10,000 gMetis tokens, they receive 100% of the reward (5,000 tokens).</li>
                                        <li>If the user holds no tokens, they receive 20% of the reward (1,000 tokens).</li>
                                        <li>For other amounts, the reward \( A \) is calculated as:
                                            <pre>A = 5000 × (0.2 + (H / 10000) × 0.8)</pre>
                                            where \( H \) is the number of gMetis tokens held by the user.
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>Reward Distribution</strong>: The AI agent initiates an on-chain transaction to send the calculated reward to the winner's wallet.</li>
                                <li><strong>Public Ledger Update</strong>: The AI agent updates the public ledger or the reward distribution section on the website.</li>
                            </ol>
                
                            <h2>Criteria for Selecting Winners</h2>
                            <p>Winners are chosen based on their interaction metrics, such as the number of messages and the quality of their contributions. The AI ensures the selection process is fair and transparent.</p>
